    <h2>Body Mass Index</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure used to determine an individual&#39;s health given their weight and height. The measurement is defined as follows:</p>

<p>\[(Weight * 703)/(Height^2)\]</p>

<p>Accordingly, defined by certain ranges, it is possible to determine an individual&#39;s weight category as underweight, normal or healthy weight, overweight, or obese. BMI can be an indicator of high body fatness, if one measures on the high end of the scale.</p>

    <h2>Accuracy of BMI</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), BMI does not measure fat directly, but is known to be moderately correlated with more direct measures of body fat, including skinfold thickness, bioelectrical impedance, underwater weighing, and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, among other methods. It is also associated with many metabolic and disease outcomes.</p>

<p>However, due to its simplicity, BMI can easily miscategorize many otherwise healthy weight individuals as overweight, particularly among fit individuals with heavy muscle mass, such as professional athletes. For example, a recent Telegraph articles notes that a &quot;6-ft tall Olympic 100-meter sprinter weighting 90kg (200lbs) may have the same BMI as a couch potato of the same weight and height.&quot; As such, it could be helpful to use other measures in tandem with BMI in order to better understand one&#39;s weight in a fuller context.</p>

    <h2>Waist-to-Height Ratio</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Recent studies have shown that&#39;s measuring one&#39;s waist as a proportion of one&#39;s height can actually be a better indicator of health than other similarly non-invasive, inexpensive measures. Carrying excess body fat around one&#39;s middle is associated with increased disease risks. Checking that waist-to-height is less than 0.5 is an indicator that one is likely in a health weight range. The measurement is defined as follows:</p>

<p>\[ waist/height \]</p>

<p>The waist-to-height ratio would reduce misclassification of individuals with greater muscle mass, as well as identify individuals identified by BMI as a normal weight, as overweight instead by comparison of their waistline to height. One particular study be Oxford Brookes University found that more than one-third of those classified as normal under BMI would have been considered overweight using the waist-to-height ratio.</p>

    <h2>Using the Health Indicators Application</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>You can input your height, weight, waist, and gender into the application to determine your BMI and your waist-to-height ratio, as well as see where you fall within the ranges for each. This application may be useful for persons age 16 and older who are not pregnant, as children and pregnant women have their own particular ranges for healthy weights. Given their simplicity, these methods are limited in their usefulness as a personal indicator of health, but do provide insights when measures across populations as a whole. As always, it is important to talk with your doctor about the implications of these numbers and what they mean for your individual health.</p>
